Scripts useful with emphemeral cloud machines (eg. Google Cloud Shell), mainly used for setting up the machine's temporary working environment and executing
various scripts and tasks.

## Included utilities

### OCR script

This script is used for OCR via Tesseract. Also downloads and sets up [croc](https://github.com/schollz/croc) for convenient file transfers. Default OCR locale is set to *Czech (ces)* in this script. Works with Debian-based systems. Non-debian version might be available at a later date.
